Battleship game using javascript
My program “Battleship” was written in JavaScript. The purpose of this program is to create a fun, interactive game that is customizable with how difficult the user wants the game to be. The user must try and guess where the computer randomly placed its battleship. The user is able to use hints such as how far away in distance the point is to where they just guessed and whether their guess is “hot”, “cold”, or “warm.” If the user wins guesses correctly a gold medal pops up on the screen. If not, they can see in the comment box that they lost.
